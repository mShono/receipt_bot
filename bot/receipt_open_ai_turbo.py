                                If the text is in finnish. You also need to shorten long product names to a short one 
                                that conveys the essence, and figure out which words were shortened, for example: 
                                'kirsikkatomatti' instead of 'Luumukirsikkatomatti', 'kanan jauheliha' instead of 'Kanamestari kanan jauhel',

                                There also will be some products, which names are difficult to recognize - leave them as they are. 
                                Exampe: "Vemondo Luomu mantelij. sokt"
                                Under the product names, it can be written how many servings of the product were purchased at what price, 
                                for example: 3 x 2,95 EUR
                                The price is where there is a designation EUR or â‚¬. 
                                You should give me the price for the total ammount of product, in the above example it is 8,85.
                                If underneath the product there's an information about discount, you should return the product price considering the discount.
                                Return the data as a JSON array of products with their prices, like this:
                                [{{'name': "Product1", "price": 9.99}}, {{"name": "Product2", "price": 4.50}}]
                                Don't give me any additional information, text, formating, just the JSON array"""
